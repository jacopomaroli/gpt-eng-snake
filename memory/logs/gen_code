The game should have the following features:\n\n1. The game should be able to handle multiple players simultaneously.\n2. Each player should control their own snake with the arrow keys on their keyboard.\n3. The game should have a grid-based playing field.\n4. The snakes should move continuously in the direction they are facing.\n5. The snakes should die if they collide with the walls or with each other.\n6. The snakes should grow in length when they eat food that appears randomly on the playing field.\n7. The game should keep track of each player's score.\n8. The game should end when only one snake is left alive, and that snake should be declared the winner.\n\nCore classes:\n- `Game`: This class will manage the game state and handle incoming player actions.\n- `Player`: This class will represent a player in the game and store their score and snake.\n- `Snake`: This class will represent a snake in the game and handle its movement and growth.\n- `Food`: This class will represent the food that appears on the playing field and handle its random placement.\n\nCore functions/methods:\n- `Game.start()`: This method will start the game and initialize the playing field, players, and snakes.\n- `Game.update()`: This method will update the game state every frame and handle collisions between snakes and food.\n- `Game.end()`: This method will end the game and declare the winner.\n- `Player.move()`: This method will handle the player's arrow key input and update the direction of their snake.\n- `Snake.move()`: This method will move the snake in its current direction and handle its growth when it eats food.\n- `Food.place()`: This method will randomly place the food on the playing field.\n\nHTML and JS:\n- `index.html`: This file will contain the HTML markup for the game canvas and player scoreboards.\n- `style.css`: This file will contain the CSS styling for the game canvas and player scoreboards.\n- `script.js`: This file will contain the JavaScript code for setting up the game canvas, handling player input, and streaming the game state to all connected players."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Unit tests:\n\nHere are some example tests based on the specification:\n\n```python\nimport pytest\nfrom game import Game, Player, Snake, Food\n\ndef test_game_start():\n    game = Game()\n    game.start()\n    assert len(game.players) == 0\n    assert len(game.snakes) == 0\n    assert len(game.food) == 0\n\ndef test_player_move():\n    player = Player()\n    player.move(\"up\")\n    assert player.snake.direction == \"up\"\n\ndef test_snake_move():\n    snake = Snake()\n    snake.move()\n    assert snake.head_position == (0, 1)\n\ndef test_snake_grow():\n    snake = Snake()\n    snake.grow()\n    assert len(snake.body) == 2\n\ndef test_food_place():\n    food = Food()\n    food.place()\n    assert food.position != None\n\ndef test_game_update():\n    game = Game()\n    game.start()\n    game.update()\n    assert len(game.snakes) == 1\n    assert len(game.food) == 1\n\ndef test_game_end():\n    game = Game()\n    game.start()\n    game.end()\n    assert game.winner != None\n``` \n\nThese tests cover the basic functionality of the game, including starting the game, moving the player's snake, moving the snake, growing the snake, placing food, updating the game state, and ending the game.
